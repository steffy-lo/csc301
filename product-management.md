# Product Management

## Product Definition

### Goals

* High-level, concise description
* Use customer language, ignore technical details

Defining the product with objectives: the objectives you define can influence the nature and priorities of the product.

The focus is on the __**problem and users**, not the product. We only talk about the problem we want to solve, not what the product it.

**What** is the objective, **Who** are your users, **Why** would they use the product?

Personas: Identify Users/Customers

* Efficiently discuss our archetypal users \(by using names, instead of full descriptions\)
* Develop a representative character \(name, picture, background story, etc.\) to simplify communication and empathize with user groups

### Requirements

* What is needed in order to achieve goals?
  * High-level description of the **main features of our system** and the _interaction_ between them
* User Stories
  * Requirements from the user's perspective, using everyday language
  * Follow a basic pattern: As &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;action/desire&gt;, so that &lt;benefit&gt;
  * E.g. As a **personal account holder,** I want to be able to **print my transaction history** for the past 30 days, so that **I can keep track of my expenses**, As a **bike-share member**, Jenny wants to **find bicycles around her** before she leaves home so she can **plan her commute**
* Acceptance Criteria
  * Conditions that a product must satisfy to be accepted by the user in the user story
  * E.g. only transactions in the last 30 days are included, transactions are printed in a correct format, the balance is displayed for every transaction for the full period of time transactions are available

### Design

* Artifacts \(non-code product items\):
  * Mockups and wireframes
  * CRC \(Class Responsibility Collaborator\) cards
  * Class Diagrams - more detailed than CRC
